# Slide 1: Problem Overview & Solution
Title: Optimizing Energy Consumption & Savings with AI

  Problem Statement:
        Energy Cost Fluctuation: Time-of-Use (TOU) tariffs create high energy costs during peak periods.
        Energy Waste: Solar energy is often underutilized, leading to missed savings opportunities.
        Lack of Smart Management: Existing systems lack real-time decision-making for switching between power sources.

  Proposed Solution:
        AI-Driven Dynamic Power Management:
            Deep Q-Learning Agent: Learns optimal energy usage patterns to switch between grid and solar energy based on tariffs.
            Real-Time Energy Monitoring: Tracks consumption and potential savings in real-time.
            Automated Energy Source Switching: Automatically switches power sources when solar usage can lead to higher savings.

  Key Benefits:
        Maximizes Savings: Reduces grid energy costs by using solar power during peak pricing.
        Optimized Consumption: Smart scheduling of high-energy appliances during low-cost periods.
        Improves Sustainability: Efficient use of renewable energy.

# Slide 2: Business Impact & Next Steps
Title: Business Value & Roadmap for Deployment

    Business Impact:
        Cost Reduction: Average 15%-25% reduction in energy costs for users.
        Increased Efficiency: Improved energy utilization for households and businesses with solar installations.
        Sustainability Goals: Helps businesses meet renewable energy targets and reduce their carbon footprint.

    How It Works:
        Monitor & Forecast: The system predicts future energy consumption and solar production.
        Smart Scheduling: High-energy appliances (e.g., EV chargers, dishwashers) are scheduled during low-tariff periods.
        Savings Calculation: Continuous monitoring of savings from solar energy usage vs. grid energy.

    Next Steps for Deployment:
        Pilot Testing: Implement in 10-20 solar-powered households for real-world data collection.
        Cloud Deployment: Use AWS or Google Cloud to scale the backend for large user adoption.
        Monitoring & Optimization: Set up dashboards (Grafana/Prometheus) for real-time performance and savings tracking.

Design Tips:

    Slide 1 (Problem & Solution):
        Use a high-quality visual for the problem (e.g., grid with fluctuating prices) and a clean illustration of your AI-driven system.
        Include a simple flowchart that shows how the DQN agent monitors, predicts, and switches between energy sources.

    Slide 2 (Business Impact & Next Steps):
        Use an icon-based layout for benefits (e.g., cost reduction, sustainability) to make it visually appealing.
        Consider a roadmap graphic for "Next Steps" with milestones like pilot testing, cloud deployment, and scaling.
